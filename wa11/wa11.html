                   I implemented a local data storage that users can clearly see and clear their saved preferences. The website saves the user's chosen news category in their browser's local storage. I chose this because I feel like it lets users know what data is getting saved and they have an easy way to clear it if they want to.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This gives users more agency because it shows exactly whats being saved, you don't need an account so no personal info gets collected, and the data can be deleted instantly with a confirmation that it has been removed. The data also only stays in the browser not on like the "company" server itself. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I think making sure the storage was correctly implemented was a bit difficult. The saved category went away after reloading so I had to relearn how to do the storage stuff. I also wasn't sure what I needed to do with the API key itself initiallly and how that changed the code structure.
